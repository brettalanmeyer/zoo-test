# Java Coding Test

You are to develop an application for management of a zoo. You will need to represent the zoo requirements in the form of java objects. All normal java best practices should be used. The following are requirements for the zoo:

1)	The zoo is occupied by animals.
2)	The zoo can perform a Sound Off. Each animal in the zoo speaks and tells their energy level when a sound off occurs.
3)	Each animal has an integer value that keeps track of its current energy level.
4)	Each animal has an integer value that keeps track of the current number of its species that has been created.
5)	Each animal can eat, sleep, speak, and play.
6)	By default animals get +8 energy for sleeping, +3 for eating, and -5 for playing.
7)	By default animals say "Grrr" when speaking.
8)	By default animals say "YE-AH!' when playing.
9)	If an animal doesn't have enough energy to play they will say "I'm tired."
10)	Animals eat food.
11)	Animals won't eat just any food. They must know what kind of food it is.
12)	The following foods are available in the zoo: Steak, Fish, and Grain
13)	The following animals currently exist in the zoo: Lions, Tigers, and Bears.
14)	Lions speak by saying "Roar" in addition to what they would normally say.
15)	Bears get +10 energy for sleeping.
16)	Tigers get -8 energy for playing.
17)	Tigers get no energy for eating grain.
18)	Some animals can be trained. If an animal is trainable they can dance.
19)	Only a bear can be trained. When a bear dances they say "Look Ma! I'm Dancing."
20)	Two animals are considered to be the same animal (equal) if they belong to the same species and have the same energy level.
